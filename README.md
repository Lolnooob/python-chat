# python-chat
A combination of "server.py" and "client.py", "server.py" is responsible for handling connections between two devices whereas "client.py" is responsible for sending and receiving messages. My future plan is to transition this into a SvelteKit web app with all sorts of features recommended by existing chat app communities.
